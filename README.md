###Note:  All of these programs have a main method to be run separately so please to make sure you compile and run the example on its own if you are using gcc you can use:



```
gcc -o  BitChange BitChange.c  # you want: gcc -o <executable name> <file name.c> <if you need multiple files in your program list them all here>
#Note you do not need <> in the terminal or put in .h files, that is linked for you.
```

#####Then you can run it from your terminal in the directory of the executable with ./(executable name)
